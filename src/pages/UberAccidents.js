                            For many people in the Philadelphia area, rideshare
                            services like Uber are extremely beneficial. There
                            are many situations in which people open their Uber
                            apps and have a ride ready with a simple touch of a
                            button. Uber is quick, convenient, and can be a
                            lifesaver if you do not have a working vehicle, have
                            had too much to drink, or are visiting the city and
                            do not want to rent a car.

                            Most Uber users do not think twice about taking a
                            ride with a stranger. However, Uber rides can be
                            risky for many reasons and can result in crashes and
                            injuries. No two Uber accidents are the same, and
                            each case can have unique legal issues that can
                            complicate the insurance or legal process. For this
                            reason, you want to seek help from a lawyer who

                            This is a dangerously common concern when it comes
                            to Uber drivers, as they often spend long hours on

                            possible. In recent years, Uber did limit the
                            consecutive hours a driver could work. Specifically,
                            a driver can be logged in to the app for work for 12
                            hours and then, they cannot log in again for another
                            six hours. However, these restrictions are hardly
                            effective in combatting fatigued Uber drivers.

                            professional drivers. An Uber driver connects to the
                            Uber app at all times they are working. The app
                            allows them to accept rides, tells them where to
                            pick up a passenger, and how to get to the
                            passenger’s destination. Even if a driver has a
                            hands-free phone mount in their car, they will still
                            be regularly checking the screen for more

                            drivers are at a constant risk of crashing, as they
                            are constantly checking their phones as an inherent
                            part of their jobs. They can also add in other
                            distractions, such as talking on the phone, engaging
                            with passengers, eating and drinking, and more.

                            they will pay $12 even if the driver gets stuck in
                            traffic for an extra 30 minutes. With the traffic in
                            Philly, this situation is a common one. Therefore,
                            drivers often look for ways to complete as many
                            rides as possible in a short period of time, which
                            can lead to aggressive driving.

                            Uber drivers may speed or swerve through traffic to
                            get where they are going as fast as possible. Often,
                            drivers know the roads well and may have an
                            over-inflated sense of confidence when driving
                            aggressively. Aggressive driving is always
                            dangerous, as too many Philadelphians know from
                            experience, and this behavior can lead to
                            devastating Uber accidents.

                            For some reason, many passengers in Uber vehicles
                            feel safe not buckling their seat belts, especially
                            if they are sitting in the back. It is common for
                            Uber riders to ignore safety restraints and trust
                            the driver, only to be seriously injured if an
                            accident happens. Head-on collisions and rollovers
                            can be particularly dangerous for unrestrained
                            passengers, as they may be ejected from the vehicle.
                            It’s important to know that even if a passenger
                            wasn’t wearing a seat belt, a negligent driver can
                            still be held liable for injuries they cause in a
                            crash.

                            Philadelphia Uber drivers must have a vehicle that
                            meets the minimum standards, as well as maintain a
                            valid inspection certificate. While a driver might
                            meet these requirements when they begin driving,

                            inspections. A driver may notice that a tire is
                            overly work, though puts off replacing it until it
                            is necessary to pass inspection. In the meantime,
                            the tire blows on the highway and the Uber driver
                            crashes. Uber drivers are responsible for all their
                            own vehicle-related expenses, so it is no surprise
                            that some drivers try to cut dangerous corners when

                            You should always listen to first responders if they

                            that require Uber and other companies to cover
                            drivers while they are engaged in a pre-arranged
                            ride. This can be helpful, as these policies can
                            provide coverage up to $1 million, which is critical
                            for accident victims with catastrophic injuries and
                            losses.

                            No matter who your insurance claim is against, the
                            insurer will likely try to fight your compensation
                            however possible. It is always a good idea to have
                            an experienced Uber accident lawyer representing you
                            from the very beginning of your claim. Most
                            importantly, you should never accept a settlement
                            offer from an insurer without first discussing your
                            case with an attorney. Insurers are notorious for
                            tricking injured accident victims into accepting
                            much less than they need, though our legal team can
                            prevent this from happening whenever possible.
