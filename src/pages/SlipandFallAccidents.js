              Slip and fall accidents are common occurrences. Most of the time,
              slip and fall accidents cause embarrassment, and those who fall
              simply get up, brush themselves off, and go about their day.
              Unfortunately, sometimes slip and fall accidents lead to severe,
              sometimes permanent injuries. If you’ve sustained injuries in a
              Philadelphia slip and fall accident, Pennsylvania law permits you
              to take legal action if the fall resulted from another party’s
              negligence.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Severe injuries translate to costly medical treatment and require
              people to take time away from work to heal. You shouldn’t have to
              deal with the financial burden of a slip and fall accident when
              someone else caused it. The skilled Philadelphia slip and fall
              accident lawyers at The Lawyer Connection have ample experience
              advocating for victims of negligence, including those injured in

              Those who suffer injuries in a slip and fall accident claim have a

              The amount of compensation slip and fall accident victims receive
              in personal injury claims varies greatly among cases. The severity

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Slip and fall accidents lead to various injuries depending on the
              situation. Examples of some common injuries someone might suffer
              in a Philadelphia slip and fall accident include:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Fractures</span> Broken bones
                are not always grounds for a personal injury claim because
                simple breaks heal quickly and typically do not have long-term
                complications. However, complex breaks and multiple fractures
                from a fall can require surgery and leave victims with lifelong
                complications.
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Brain injuries.</span> People
                hit their heads during many slip and fall accidents, making
                falls the leading cause of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Even
                the mildest traumatic brain injury can lead to permanent brain
                damage that comes with issues like trouble with cognition,
                communication, and emotional regulation.
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Neck and back injuries.</span>
                Slip and fall accidents can lead to various injuries along the
                spinal column, including broken vertebrae, herniated discs,
                spinal cord injuries, and others that leave people with chronic
                pain and discomfort.

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Soft tissue injuries.</span>
                Sometimes falls damage ligaments, muscles, and tendons. Soft
                tissue injuries include minor sprains and strains, but they also
                include torn or detached tissue, often requiring surgery and
                leaving patients with long-term complications.{" "}

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Slip and fall accident injuries are especially serious for older
              adults, who break bones easier than younger people. Additionally,
              older adults take much longer to heal, creating more challenges.
              The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates
              that one out of four people age 65 and older suffer falls each
              year. Some of these accidents could be avoided if negligent
              property owners kept their homes and businesses safe from hazards.

              Slip and fall accidents can lead to injuries and losses that

            Most Slip and Fall Accidents Are Preventable
          </h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              State laws, including Pennsylvania’s laws, require property owners
              to maintain their buildings, land, and other spaces so they are
              safe for visitors. In the event owners cannot immediately fix a
              dangerous situation, they have a legal duty to warn visitors about
              the hazard. Property owners who do not comply with the law put
              visitors at risk for accident and injury. The skilled premises
              liability attorneys at The Lawyer Connection have the experience
              to identify when another party’s negligence leads to a slip and
              fall accident and injuries.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Ultimately, business and property owners need to regularly inspect
              their buildings and properties to identify and fix any potential
              hazards. Specific examples of negligence that could lead to
              dangerous slip and fall accidents and injuries include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Objects, furniture, or debris in driveways, walkways, or
                storefronts
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Liquid spills that are not cleaned up in a timely matter
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Wet or slippery floors without proper warning signs
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Uneven floor coverings or unsecured area rugs
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Broken or loose tiles or floorboards
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">Loose or unstretched carpet</li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Loose or broken steps or handrails
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              These situations usually serve as grounds for a personal injury
              lawsuit after someone suffers injuries. Even if a property owner
              did not know about the condition, they could be financially liable
              for injuries if they should have discovered the hazard through
              regular inspections. Typically, ignorance of a specific condition
              or hazard does not serve as a defense.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Sometimes property owners cannot immediately eliminate a slip and
              fall hazard, so they need to provide a proper warning to visitors.
              For example, if a business employee mops the floors, it takes some
              time for them to dry. The business must warn customers about
              slippery floors, which usually involves placing one or more signs
              indicating the floors are wet. The failure to warn visitors opens
              the business up to financial liability if a visitor falls on the
              slippery floor and sustains injuries.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Each slip and fall accident case is different. If you are unsure
              whether your accident and injuries occurred because of negligence,
              it’s best to consult with an experienced premises liability
              attorney. A team member from The Lawyer Connection can evaluate
              your case and determine your eligibility for compensation.

            Fighting the Insurance Company After a Philadelphia Slip and Fall
            Accident

            <p className="TextPassage">
              You might be uncertain about your next steps after sustaining
              injuries in a slip and fall accident. You need to put your health
              and well-being first and let a Philadelphia slip and fall accident
              lawyer handle the details of your claim. This shelters you from
              the stress of dealing with the insurance company and allows you
              the time you need to focus on healing.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              If we review your case and determine you have a viable slip and
              fall accident claim, our first step typically involves filing an
              insurance claim on your behalf. Depending on the location of the
              slip and fall, your injuries might fall under a business policy or
              a homeowners insurance policy. Regardless of the type of insurance
              that applies to your situation, you can be sure the insurance
              provider will take every measure possible to avoid some and all
              financial liability.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Once the insurance company receives the claim, they assign an
              adjuster to review the facts of the case and decide whether to
              approve the claim. The adjuster will gather evidence, taking
              special care to find justification to deny or devalue your claim.
              It’s common for adjusters to take the following actions when
              dealing with claimants:
            </p>
          </div>

          <h1 className="MainHeading">Request a Recorded Statement</h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Insurance adjusters typically request recorded statements from
              claimants. Sometimes they convey that giving a recorded statement
              will help your claim. You have no legal obligation to let them
              record you, and doing so can help the adjuster limit any
              settlement offer. Insurance representatives comb over recorded
              statements for justification to challenge your claim for damages,
              dispute liability, shift blame, or for anything that will help
              them reduce the value of your claim. Letting your attorney handle
              communication with the insurance company can protect you from
              these tactics and prevent the adjuster from using your statements
              against you.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h1 className="MainHeading">
            Talk You Out of Consulting with a Lawyer
          </h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Insurance companies prefer claimants who do not have legal
              representation. They know that lawyers understand the claims
              process, understand how to apply the law, and make it difficult
              for them to prey on slip and fall accident victims and other
              victims of negligence. Additionally, lawyers are all too familiar
              with the questionable tactics insurance companies use to avoid
              financial liability for their policyholders.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              You can expect an adjuster to tell you your claim is
              straightforward and you do not need to talk with a lawyer. This
              claim may or may not be true. It’s always best to consult with an
              experienced slip and fall accident attorney to let them review
              your case. Even in straightforward cases, a lawyer can often help
              clients obtain more compensation for their injuries.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h1 className="MainHeading">Make a Settlement Offer</h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Insurance adjusters who know their policyholder is at fault for a
              slip and fall accident sometimes make early settlement offers. If
              you accept a settlement offer, you must also sign an agreement
              that prevents you from seeking more compensation for the same slip
              and fall accident and injuries. Often, people believe the
              insurance adjuster made them a reasonable offer. They discover
              later that the amount was much lower than they deserved for their
              injuries. An attorney can evaluate the offer and use it as a
              starting point for negotiations.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Slip and fall accident lawyers also recognize when settlement is
              not an option, and they need to file a lawsuit on behalf of their
              client. Filing a lawsuit can motivate the insurance company to
              make a better offer to avoid an expensive trial and a larger
              potential payout if a jury rules in your favor.
