<h1 className="MainHeading">Helping Philadelphia Car Accident Victims Seek the Compensation They Deserve

                        <p className="TextPassage">
                        After a car accident in Philadelphia, you need a law firm on your side that can help you recover damages. The term “damages” refers to the victims’ losses. Compensation is available for these losses, either through a settlement or a judgment. Recovering damages after a car accident requires proving fault and establishing the losses you suffered. A Philadelphia car accident attorney can help you prove your case and obtain maximum compensation after a car crash.


                        </p>
                        <p className="TextPassage">
                        The damages available in Pennsylvania civil courts include:


                        </p>
                        <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Medical bills.</span>This includes recovery for your past and future medical bills. Rehabilitation expenses, surgeries, treatment, doctor’s office visits, and disability costs are some of the damages you can recover.
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Lost wages.</span> An accident may cause you to miss valuable time at work. This can directly impact your ability to earn a living and pay your living expenses. Any settlement or judgment you receive should reimburse you for lost wages.
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Loss of future earnings</span>
                When your injuries result in a disability or long-term damage, you may not be able to work in your chosen profession. You can request payment for lost future earnings if you suffered a disability after a Philadelphia car accident.
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Property damage.</span>
                Car accidents often cause significant property damage. This can include damage to your car and other personal belongings in the vehicle, such as cell phones, laptops, and car seats. You could recover the full value of your car before the accident if your crash resulted in a complete loss.
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Pain and suffering.</span>This is one type of non-economic damage you can seek. Non-economic damages cover losses that are more difficult to quantify, including pain, suffering, and emotional distress.
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Punitive damages. </span>Sometimes, a judge will order punitive damages. These types of damages are rare, but they seek to punish the negligent driver for their actions
              </li>
            </ul>
                        <p className="TextPassage">
                        Pennsylvania operates under modified comparative negligence law. This means that if you are more than 50% to blame for the accident, you cannot seek to recover damages. If you are found to share liability for the crash, your damages will be reduced by your percentage of fault.

</p>
<p className="TextPassage">
There are sometimes caps on the amount of compensation you can obtain. Our Pennsylvania car accident lawyers will review your case and help you determine how much you could receive if you file a Pennsylvania car accident lawsuit.

                        As lawyers who represent victims of Philadelphia car accidents, we spend a lot of time and energy thinking about fault, and for good reason. Under Pennsylvania law, who was at fault in a motor vehicle accident determines who owes damages to the victim and how much the victim should recover. As such, we focus on identifying who was at fault in a car accident as soon as possible.

                            Philadelphia Uber drivers must have a vehicle that
                            meets the minimum standards, as well as maintain a
                            valid inspection certificate. While a driver might
                            meet these requirements when they begin driving,
                            there is little to stop them from ignoring problems
                            with their vehicles that arise in between
                            inspections. A driver may notice that a tire is
                            overly work, though puts off replacing it until it
                            is necessary to pass inspection. In the meantime,
                            the tire blows on the highway and the Uber driver
                            crashes. Uber drivers are responsible for all their
                            own vehicle-related expenses, so it is no surprise
                            that some drivers try to cut dangerous corners when
                            it comes to vehicle maintenance.

                            accident. As mentioned, Uber passengers may often

                            the medical attention you need as soon as possible.
                            You should always listen to first responders if they
                            say you need emergency transportation. Otherwise,
                            you should still visit the emergency room as soon as

                            A doctor can discover injuries that you didn’t know

                            and disoriented because the crash “shook you up,”
                            when in reality, you have a serious concussion. A
                            doctor will record all of your injuries and
                            diagnoses, which you can later use as important
