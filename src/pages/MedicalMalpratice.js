          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Medical malpractice happens in many ways, and the effects of a
              doctor’s or a hospital’s negligence can lead to catastrophic
              injuries. Medical malpractice occurs when a physician, nurse, or
              other health care provider deviates from the appropriate standard
              of care in the medical community and injures a patient. The most
              common types of medical malpractice include anesthesia mistakes,
              improper treatment, failure to deliver a baby properly,
              prescribing the wrong medication or the incorrect dosage of a
              drug, diagnosis errors, performing surgery improperly or
              performing surgery that was not necessary, failure to diagnose
              cancer and other conditions, infections that occur from improperly
              sterilized equipment or facilities, and failing to obtain a
              patient’s informed consent before performing surgery or other
              procedures.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              When you go to a doctor or other healthcare professional seeking
              care, you rightfully expect that the care you receive will make
              your condition better, not worse. Unfortunately, not all doctors
              are created equal and some fail to provide the standard of care
              expected in the medical profession.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Medical malpractice is a widespread problem that can happen to any
              patient when they least expect it. While medical malpractice laws
              recognize that injured patients should have the right to seek
              financial recovery, such laws are strict and can be confusing. For
              this reason, if you have been injured by poor medical care, it is
              time to consult a medical malpractice attorney. With the help of a
              skilled Philadelphia medical malpractice lawyer, you can be
              compensated for the injuries you received at the hands of a
              doctor, nurse, or hospital.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Every doctor and similar medical professional has the
              responsibility to act with a certain duty of care. This duty of
              care is to perform in a way that a similarly situated medical
              professional with reasonable skill and competence would have
              performed under the same circumstances. When a doctor fails to
              uphold this standard of care[1] and a patient suffers unnecessary
              injury, medical malpractice occurs.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Medical errors can be minor or they can be severe, even causing
              the death of a patient who otherwise would have survived. In an
              article regarding medical malpractice, Forbes Magazine reported[2]
              that an estimated 200,000 people die as a result of medical errors
              on an annual basis. Even if patients survive the medical error,
              such mistakes can cause unnecessary complications, can exacerbate
              medical conditions, or even cause new illnesses or injuries that
              otherwise would not have been suffered.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Though medical malpractice is relatively rare—as most medical
              professionals do meet the appropriate standard of care—it is
              important to be educated on the different types of medical
              malpractice and how they can affect you a loved one. The following
              are brief overviews of the most common types of medical
              malpractice in the United States.

            Failure To Diagnose, Delay In Diagnosis, Or Misdiagnosis
          </h2>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              When you go to an emergency department or doctor’s office
              presenting certain symptoms, the doctor should ask all of the
              appropriate questions, run all of the proper tests, and take any
              other necessary steps to accurately and completely diagnose your
              condition. Unfortunately, some medical professionals do not delve
              deep enough into a patient’s medical history or symptoms to
              correctly diagnose their condition in a timely fashion.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              For example, the symptoms of a minor heart attack are often
              similar to that of acid reflux. Too often, doctors diagnose a
              patient with acid reflux and send them home with medication, only
              to have the patient have a more severe heart event at a later
              date. On many occasions, if the doctor had performed tests such as
              an electrocardiogram or an angiogram, or had simply asked more
              about the patient’s family medical history, the first heart attack
              would have been easily diagnosed and the patient would have
              received proper treatment to avoid future episodes.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Diagnosis issues often cause additional complications because it
              causes a delay in the proper treatment for a patient’s illness.
              For instance, if a cancer patient receives a diagnosis at stage
              one, the disease can often be successfully treated. If a doctor
              error causes the diagnosis to be delayed to stage four, the
              patient has a much lesser chance of survival even with treatment.

              When you have symptoms of an illness arise, your first instinct

              provider to have any medical condition diagnosed. There are many
              tools that doctors have for diagnosing illnesses and a proper
              diagnosis is imperative to ensure you receive the necessary
              treatment for your condition. Unfortunately, a large number of
              patients receive an inaccurate diagnosis each and every year in

              While any medical condition could potentially be misdiagnosed,
              there are some conditions that are misdiagnosed more regularly
              than others and that can caus particular harm to patients. The
              following are some examples of commonly misdiagnosed illnesses.

                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Heart Attack</span> – One of
                the main symptoms of a heart attack is chest pain, however,
                there are many other signs that a patient has suffered a heart
                attack and may have serious heart disease. However, in many
                situations, a heart attack can be misdiagnosed as a panic attack
                or even simple indigestion. This results in patients with
                serious cardiovascular risks being sent home from the emergency
                department or doctor’s office with antacids or anti-anxiety
                medication. In many cases, these patients may have needed heart
                medicine or even surgery to protect them from future heart
                attacks. Without the proper treatment, many patients will suffer

                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Cancer</span> – Different
                types of cancers can have widely varying symptoms. Symptoms like
                fatigue, weakness, or nausea can often be misdiagnosed as a wide
                range of simpler illnesses, especially if there is no obvious
                tumor site. However, when cancer is diagnosed in the early
                stages of the disease, there is a much better chance of
                successfully treating cancer with less severe treatments.
                However, cancer that is not diagnosed initially can quickly
                progress into later stages of the disease, which can require
                significantly more invasive and aggressive treatments such as
                surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. These treatments can make
                a cancer patient seriously ill and can lower their immune
                system, thereby increasing the risks of life-threatening
                illness. Sometimes, if a cancer diagnosis is delayed too long,
                the disease may not be treatable at all and may be fatal

          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
            It is important for injured patients to understand that Philadelphia medical malpractice claims are significantly different and often much more complicated than ordinary personal injury claims. This is why it is important to find a Philadelphia medical malpractice lawyer who is familiar with the process and the laws, which can vary significantly from state to state.



</p>
<p className="TextPassage">
For example, in Pennsylvania, the following laws may have a substantial impact on your case:

</p>
            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
              Statute of Limitations – This is the time limit that you have to file a claim with the civil courts. In many situations, this time limit is fairly straightforward. However, in medical malpractice claims, many variables can affect what the statute of limitations may be in your case. For example, the following may apply:
              </li>

                  <ul>
                    <li className="TextPassage">
                    Two years from the date you reasonably discovered that you suffered an injury due to a medical professional;
                    </li>
                    <li className="TextPassage">
                    Seven years from the date of the injury even if you did not discover it until late (this time limit does not apply if you had a foreign object left in your body);

                     </li>
                    <li className="TextPassage">
                    For minors, seven years from their 20th birthday, regardless of when the injury happened or was discovered;
                    </li>
                    <li className="TextPassage">
                    For cases resulting in death, two years from the wrongful death.

                    </li>
                  </ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
              Damage Caps – Unlike many states, Pennsylvania does not have laws that limit the economic damages or non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases, which can be for medical bills, pain and suffering, and more. Instead, the law only limits the amount of punitive damages you can seek, which are damages awarded to punish the doctor. While punitive damages are rare, they can be awarded in cases involving particularly egregious or intentional actions on the part of your doctor. Punitive damages are capped at twice the amount of the economic damages you suffered.
              </li>

             
            </ul>
            <p className="TextPassage">
            There are also laws that address when damages must be paid periodically, the requirements for the testimony of experts, contributory negligence, and many other legal issues that may be present in a medical malpractice case. If you have been injured as a result of a doctor’s negligence, you have a limited time to act. The sooner you meet with a Philadelphia medical malpractice attorney attorney, the sooner the process can start.
