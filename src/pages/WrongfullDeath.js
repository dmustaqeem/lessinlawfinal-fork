            Who Can Bring A Wrongful Death Lawsuit?

            <p className="TextPassage">
              If your loved one was wrongfully killed you and your family might
              be entitled to financial compensation. Our Philadelphia wrongful
              death lawyers represent you, a family member or friend who has
              lost a loved one due to an accident, contact The Lawyer Connection
              who represent every client zealously in order to obtain the best
              results possible in each case.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              The purpose of a wrongful death lawsuit is to shift the financial
              burden of someone’s death from the surviving family to the person
              or organization responsible for the death. The law recognizes that
              it is unfair for grieving family members to have to suffer
              financially when neither they nor the deceased are to blame. To
              that end, the Pennsylvania Wrongful Death Act allows the personal
              representative of the estate to bring a lawsuit for compensation
              on behalf of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">The victim’s spouse</li>

              <li className="TextPassage">The victim’s minor children</li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Adult children who were dependent on the victim
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">The victim’s parents</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              The law recognizes that the above groups of people are the most
              financially harmed when someone dies. Furthermore, spouses and
              children have close emotional bonds with their spouse or parent,
              relying on them for emotional support and guidance. The law will
              also compensate survivors for the loss of these relationships.
              More distant relatives, like siblings or cousins, are not allowed
              to benefit from a wrongful death lawsuit in Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              If the personal representative does not file a wrongful death
              lawsuit within 6 months of the death, then any of the above
              beneficiaries can bring a lawsuit themselves.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Damages may be awarded for funeral and burial expenses, loss of
              future income, pain and suffering, loss of consortium (loss of a
              loved one’s companionship or care), and punitive damages intended
              to punish the defendant for their negligence.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              We know that no amount of money will ever replace or bring back
              your loved one. But it may help bring your family closure to know
              that justice has been served against those responsible for your
              loved one’s wrongful death, and give you the comfort of knowing
              your family will be provided for well into the future.

          <h1 className="MainHeading">What Do You Need To Prove?</h1>

          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              A wrongful death claim is called a “derivative” claim, meaning
              that you basically step into the deceased’s shoes and bring
              whatever lawsuit they could have brought had they lived. For
              example, if your loved one was killed by a defective product, they
              would have been able to bring a product’s liability lawsuit had
              they lived. Or, if the deceased was killed by someone’s
              negligence, then they could have brought a negligence lawsuit had
              they lived.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              As the person bringing a wrongful death lawsuit, you will need to
              prove whatever the deceased would have needed to prove. For
              example, you might need to show that product piece of equipment
              was dangerous because it had a defect. This defect might be a
              manufacturing defect or a design defect. Or you might show that
              the product was defective because the manufacturer didn’t supply
              sufficient instructions or safety warnings. Once you establish
              that the product was defective and that it caused your loved one’s
              death, then the manufacturer is strictly liable for the injuries.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Many wrongful death lawsuits are also brought for “negligence,”
              which is the legal term for carelessness. On construction job
              sites, many people are responsible for making the site reasonably
              safe. If they fail to exercise that reasonable care, and your
              loved one died as a result, then you can bring your wrongful death
              claim based on negligence. You’ll need to prove the following four
              elements:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Duty:</span> The defendant
                owed your loved one a duty to exercise reasonable care.
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Breach:</span>
                The defendant didn’t exercise reasonable care (a breach).
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Damages:</span>
                Your loved one died.
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Causation:</span>
                The defendant’s breach of reasonable care caused the death.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              For example, the job site owner might not have informed the
              contractor or the construction crew that the soil on the job site
              is constantly shifting. If the ground shifts and ends up killing
              your loved one, then you might be able to sue the premises owner
              for negligence for failing to inform the necessary parties that
              the ground was dangerous.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Grieving family members are not required to know who to sue. You
              weren’t at the accident scene and have no way of knowing the
              details of what caused your loved one’s death. In the aftermath of
              your loved one’s death, your sole focus should be on your family’s
              physical and emotional well-being. Leave the fact-finding to the
              personal injury lawyers at The Lawyer Connection who can visit the
              job site and interview witnesses to identify the party responsible
              for your loved one’s death.

          <h1 className="MainHeading">Preserving Evidence</h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              It is important to contact an attorney right away if you have lost
              a loved one in a construction accident. The nature of a
              construction site is that it is constantly changing, and it is
              important that the site is investigated, observed and photographed
              in the same condition that it was in when the accident occurred.
              Property owners may try to fix or cover up the dangerous condition
              that caused the accident, or it may be eliminated on its own as
              part of the original construction plans. That’s why you need an
              attorney who will work quickly and efficiently to ensure that you
              have the strongest case possible so that you can fully recover.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Building a strong wrongful death lawsuit requires skill and
              expertise that only an experienced personal injury lawyer can
              provide. For example, if you are suing a product manufacturer for
              selling a defective dangerous product, you’ll probably need an
              expert witness who can identify a design or manufacturing defect
              for the jury. Or if you are arguing that the job site was
              dangerous due to negligence, you’ll need someone knowledgeable
              about various safety laws to testify as to how the defendant
              breached their duty of reasonable care.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Identifying appropriate expert witnesses takes a lot of time and
              is not something you can do on your own. Good experts must have
              sufficient knowledge and experience to qualify as expert
              witnesses, but they also need to be able to describe complicated
              issues in a way that laypeople can understand. At The Lawyer
              Connection, our personal injury lawyers have years of experience
              building cases with the held of expert witnesses, and we are
              prepared to help you prove your case in court.

              Two mothers recently lost their children in a daycare fire. An
              electrical failure caused by a routinely used extension cord

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Losing a loved one in such a way is an unimaginably painful
              experience made even worse if the death results from someone
              else’s negligence or recklessness. For some families, taking legal
              action in the wake of a tragedy serves to hold someone accountable
              and to prevent future disasters. For others, the death of a loved
              one brings expenses and impacts to the lives of family members
              that compensation can help remedy.

              Grieving families need compensation to pay expenses and begin to
              put their lives back together. As you mourn the loss of your loved
              one, you might find it difficult to talk with other people or even
              to leave the house. Nevertheless, you still need to carve out some
              time to meet with a Philadelphia wrongful death attorney because
              Pennsylvania law does not give you an unlimited amount of time to
              sue. Instead, you are only given 2 years from the date of your
              loved one’s death to start a wrongful death lawsuit in the
              appropriate court.
