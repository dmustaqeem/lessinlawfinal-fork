            <p className="TextPassage">
            Distracted drivers are less aware of their surroundings and often do not see motorcyclists until it is too late. While many of use tend to immediately think about smartphones when we think about distracted driving,1 distractions can take be much less high-tech. Some examples of the kinds of things that drivers can do and distract themselves include the following:

            <p className="TextPassage">
            Despite public education campaigns aimed at educating people about the dangers of drunk driving and harsh penalties for even first-time offenders, people continue to drive drunk on a daily basis in the Philadelphia area. Drunk drivers pose a significant safety risk to motorcyclists as alcohol intoxication can affect a person’s spatial awareness, reaction time, and judgment. If you suspect that the driver who caused your accident was drunk, you should be sure to call the police.

            <p className="TextPassage">
            Poor road maintenance is a significant factor in many accidents, especially those involving just one vehicle. Issues like potholes, overgrown vegetation, inadequate signage, faded paint, broken stoplights, poor drainage, and excessive grade can very easily cause a serious motorcycle crash.


            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
            It is important for the victim to be aware of the fact that when accidents caused by poor road maintenance occur on public property, claims arising from them are subject to a special set of legal rules that govern legal actions against public entities. These kinds of claims are subject to significant time limits, so victims should be certain to speak to an attorney as soon as possible.

            Defectively manufactured, designed, or marketed motorcycles can cause extremely serious accidents, often with little to no warning.

            More than one defendant may face legal liabilities in a motorcycle accident that a roadway hazard or negligent driver caused. First and foremost, motorcycle passengers may sue the motorcycle operator for driving in a negligent manner, such as driving too fast through a construction site or on a roadway filled with potholes. Motorcycle passengers may also sue the driver of another motor vehicle who negligently caused an accident or collision.

            In motorcycle accidents involving construction sites and defective road conditions, the injured motorcycle operator or passenger may sue the construction company or responsible government for negligent or defective road repair work or for creating (or failing to properly maintain or correct) a hazardous condition on the roadway. In lawsuits involving governmental entities, such as cities, counties, townships, or municipalities, however, special limitation periods and filing deadlines may apply.

Pennsylvania is home to some of the most scenic motorcycle routes in the country. Motorcyclists can follow the Lake Erie coastline, travel one of the federal or state-designated Scenic Byways, roll through the hills and valleys of the Pocono Mountains, visit one of the charming country towns in Amish country, or travel to the cradle of American independence in Philadelphia.


</p>
<p className="TextPassage">
But no matter how enjoyable, traveling by motorcycle also comes with serious risks. Motorcycle riders have virtually no protection from the impact of a collision. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 4,985 motorcyclists died in crashes in 2018 on U.S. roads.



</p>
<p className="TextPassage">
Although this number represents a welcome decrease of almost 5 percent from the previous year, motorcycle riders still account for 14 percent of all traffic-related fatalities. Based on 2018 statistics, in Pennsylvania, there were 164 motorcycle fatalities. Of these, 153 (93.3 percent) were riders, and 11 (6.7 percent) were passengers.

          Additional Non Economic Damages

          </h3>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
          <p className="TextPassage">
          To relate these non-economic damages to the motorcycle accident, the injured accident victim will need to seek mental health treatments or counseling. Afterward, a victim may submit the medical records and bills, which constitute medical evidence, to the at-fault party’s insurance company to verify the nature and extent of the treatments and link the treatments to the motorcycle accident.

</p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
            In addition to introducing medical evidence, the injured accident victim will likely need to introduce the medical testimony of a qualified mental health provider, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, who can testify about the extent of the accident victim’s treatments—as well as the cost thereof. If the injured accident victim suffered from a preexisting medical condition or mental health disorder, the expert may allege that the accident victim’s condition worsened as a result of the motorcycle accident.

</p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
            In cases where the injured motorcyclist suffered mental anguish, emotional distress, anxiety, or other mental health conditions following injuries sustained ina motorcycle accident, the at-fault driver’s insurance company then has a legal right to explore other potential causes of these conditions. This becomes especially problematic in cases where the injured plaintiff has a history of “pill popping” or illicit drug use, which could be evident in medical records.

</p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
            The knowledgeable motorcycle accident lawyers at The Lawyer Connection can retain the necessary medical experts and mental health providers to connect your non-economic injuries and damages to your motorcycle accident, helping to increase the potential compensation you may receive from your case.

          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
          <p className="TextPassage">
          Non-economic injuries and damages, including emotional injuries and mental distress damages, can be speculative and difficult to prove in some motorcycle accident cases. However, for many motorcycle accident victims, the reality is that their lives are forever changed following their accident. Some accident victims even suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder—or PTSD—following their accident.


</p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
            You may have a hard time proving the existence of mental injuries and damages following a motorcycle accident. Moreover, insurance companies and their adjusters oftentimes try to limit the injured accident victim’s right to monetary compensation for those types of injuries and damages. For example, the insurance company may allege that the accident victim previously suffered from mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression, before the motorcycle accident. The insurance company may also look to instances of psychological or psychiatric treatments that predated the motorcycle accident.
